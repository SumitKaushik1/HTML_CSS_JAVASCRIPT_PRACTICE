				 A protostar is what you have before a star forms. A protostar is a collection of gas that has 
				 collapsed down from a giant molecular cloud. The protostar phase of stellar evolution lasts about 
				 100,000 years. Over time, gravity and pressure increase, forcing the protostar to collapse down. 
				 All of the energy release by the protostar comes only from the heating caused by the gravitational 
				 energy – nuclear fusion reactions haven’t started yet.

				 <font  size=5 color="white">
				  A T Tauri star is stage in a star’s formation and evolution right before it becomes a main 
				  sequence star. This phase occurs at the end of the protostar phase, when the gravitational 
				  pressure holding the star together is the source of all its energy. T Tauri stars don’t have
				  enough pressure and temperature at their cores to generate nuclear fusion, but they do 
				 resemble main sequence stars; they’re about the same temperature but brighter because 
				 they’re a larger. T Tauri stars can have large areas of sunspot coverage, and have 
				 intense X-ray flares and extremely powerful stellar winds. Stars will remain in the T 
				 Tauri stage for about 100 million years.
